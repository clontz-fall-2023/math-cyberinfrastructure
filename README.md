## Course Description

Exploration of technologies used to research and communicate modern mathematics, including programming languages and software,
markup languages and processing tools, databases, proof verification systems, version control systems, and web-based mechanisms
for mathematics communication.

## Course Outline (tentative)

- Week 1: GitHub, Codespaces, and Markdown
- Week 2: StackExchange Network
- Week 3: Infrastructure of the modern web
- Week 4: LaTeX and PreTeXt
- Week 5: Python
- Week 6: SageMath
- Week 7: Jupyter Notebooks
- Week 8: SpaTeXt and CheckIt
- Week 9: Mathematical databases
- Week 10: Formalized mathematics in Lean
- Week 11: Copyright and licensing
- Weeks 12&13: Euler Problems
- Weeks 14&15: Flex and ePortfolio writing/feedback

After each week’s meeting, students will be assigned homework that will be incorporated into their course ePortfolio. Homework submitted on time will receive feedback from the instructor, to help ensure submissions will meet expectations when the ePortfolio is assessed.

## Course Materials

No textbook is assigned to this course, but many readings and resources will be assigned/provided by the instructor throughout the semester.

## Class Attendance

Students who miss four or more course meetings will receive a U* mark in place of U if they do not Satisfactorily complete their ePortfolio. Students who attend class will receive additional feedback and support from the instructor; students who are absent or do not submit work on time will miss out on that feedback and are less likely to complete a Satisfactory ePortfolio by the end of the course.

## Assessment

By the end of the semester, each student will submit an ePortfolio documenting their competency with each of the technologies explored throughout the semester, appropriate for inclusion with a resume or CV. The ePortfolio will be marked according to a rubric, and students’ overall course grade will be marked as Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory based upon this submission. Students may choose to submit their ePortfolio by an early deadline; if so, they will receive feedback and an opportunity to resubmit the ePortfolio if it does not yet meet expectations to Satisfactorily pass the course.

## Modifications for MA494-106

This directed study will be an enhanced version of the 1hr MA490 Special Topics course being offered on Mathematical Cyberinfrastructure. The student will complete all activities asked of students in MA490, including regular attendance on Fridays 2:35-3:25pm, as well as two additional contact hours in the instructor’s office each week. As part of the expanded scope of this course, the student will be mentored in a project exploring how several of the skills explored can be connected to the content of MA237 Linear Algebra, in particular, how technology can be applied to automate many of the tasks students in MA237 typically do through written calculation.

By the end of the semester, the student will submit an ePortfolio that includes this special project, as well as meeting the requirements set forth for MA490 students. A rubric will be used to assign a letter grade of A-F for the course based upon this submission, with feedback and resubmission policies as described in the MA490 syllabus.

## Modifications for MA590-102

MA590 students will additionally be required to appropriately integrate their graduate coursework or research into some aspect of their ePortfolio.
